During this event, there are various ways to earn Chrono Crystals. These methods vary in difficulty, but with the right strategies, you can maximize your rewards and stockpile Chrono Crystals for upcoming Summons.

### 1. **Daily and Weekly Missions**

One of the easiest and most consistent ways to farm Chrono Crystals during Legends Festival 2024 is by completing daily and weekly missions. These missions are simple tasks that give you small but regular rewards. During the Legends Festival, special missions are often introduced that offer bonus Chrono Crystals for completing specific event-related objectives.

#### Daily Missions:

- Participate in specific event modes

#### Weekly Missions:
- Clear stages in event modes like the *Legends Festival* special event stages
- Complete a certain number of PvP matches
- Rank up in certain event-specific rankings

By staying active and checking your missions each day, you can steadily accumulate Chrono Crystals throughout the event.

### 2. **Special Legends Festival Event Stages**

The Legends Festival often brings exclusive event stages where you can earn significant rewards, including Chrono Crystals. These stages usually involve defeating powerful bosses, completing challenges, or participating in specific themed events. Make sure to clear these stages as often as possible to maximize your crystal farming efforts.

For instance, during Legends Festival 2024, certain event stages may drop Chrono Crystals as completion rewards, with bonuses for clearing them with higher difficulty levels or within a time limit.

### 3. **Complete the Story Mode**

Story Mode is a tried and tested method for accumulating Chrono Crystals, and during Legends Festival 2024, it’s even better. With special bonuses tied to completing certain chapters or missions, you can earn up to hundreds of Chrono Crystals by progressing through the story. If you haven’t already completed all the chapters in Story Mode, now is the perfect time to revisit them.

Additionally, new storylines tied to Legends Festival 2024 may be introduced, giving you even more opportunities to earn Chrono Crystals by following the new narrative content.

### 4. **PvP Mode (Ranked Battles)**

PvP (Player vs. Player) battles are another excellent method to earn Chrono Crystals. During the Legends Festival, special ranked events are often held, where top-tier players can earn large rewards based on their performance in the ladder. Even if you don’t make it to the top, you can still earn Chrono Crystals by simply participating in ranked matches.

Look for the Legends Festival-specific PvP rewards, which may offer increased Chrono Crystals for every rank you achieve during the event. These rewards are often tiered, so the more you play and win, the better your rewards will be.

### 5. **Z Missions**

Z Missions are a long-term method to farm Chrono Crystals, and they are one of the best ways to make sure you’re always accumulating valuable resources in *Dragon Ball Legends*. These missions are more challenging but rewarding, and during Legends Festival 2024, there are likely to be special Z Missions that provide additional rewards tied to the event.

Be sure to focus on completing Z Missions that grant Chrono Crystals, as these will help you accumulate a large number of them over time.

Additionally, keep an eye out for any special rewards given for logging in during specific dates or completing certain objectives within a time frame. These bonuses are typically designed to encourage consistent play and engagement.

### 8. **Use Your Chrono Crystals Wisely**

While it’s important to farm as many Chrono Crystals as possible, it’s equally essential to use them wisely. During the Legends Festival, there are often special Summons with limited-time characters that are highly sought after. Spend your Chrono Crystals on banners that offer the best value, such as those featuring anniversary units or powerful new characters.
